# IMDb_review_sentiment_analysis
Sentiment analysis using IMDb movie reviews dataset

In this project, an RNN-based learning model is built to detect sentiment (i.e. detect if a sentence is positive or negative) using PyTorch and TorchText. 
This is done on movie reviews, using the IMDb dataset. Different models of RNN are used, namely, bidirectional RNN, multi-layered RNN and a bi-LSTM.
